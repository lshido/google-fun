# Description
google-fun is where I keep my code solutions for the google foobar challenge.
The ones that get published are ones that I have submitted.
I also have my own set of unit tests that are modeled off the non-hidden tests.

# Other Tidbits
It might seem strange for me to have packaged this, but I just did it so I could import my methods for unit testing. TDD FTW!
Please be cool and don't cheat on the foobar challenge by submitting my solutions as your own. You could probably find better, more elegant solutions from someone else, and besides, what's the fun in copying and pasting someone else's work?
